## Features
- Low latency serial communication
- Analyzation and visualization of audio data
- Visualization of user-drawn data (Custom Effects Builder)
- Pre-programmed effects (⏰Time, 🐍Snake Game, 🚶Animations...)
- Interactive user interface


## Compatibility
### Matrix
Compatibility has been tested on a 4x1 Max7219 LED Dot Matrix\
With some tweaks the software could work on bigger or smaller Max7219 dot matrices.
### Microcontroller
An Arduino UNO microcontroller has been used in the development of this project.\
Some microcontrollers that don't supply enough amps might be incompatible.

## Installation

Windows
